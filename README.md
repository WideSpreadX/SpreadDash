# Welcome to WideSpread

Thank you so much for your interest in volunteering!!! A quick brief on the project... I started it about a year ago... It wasn't ACTUALLY built for COVID per say... but, it is PERFECT for it. This WAS a secret project, but like you said, this is for humanity, right here right now, screw a secret project, right?

So, the Project:

Name: WideSpread
Scope: Online Operating System with a user interface we're all used to, but it also turns into an AR/VR Operating system with a dynamic desktop. I'll attach a few testing videos to catch you up! Once again, Thank you so much for anything and everything your able to help us with!!

Feel free to call/text me with any questions at any time 24/7, I don't sleep much -  (352)446-8043
